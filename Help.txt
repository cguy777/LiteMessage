Display Name:
determines what will show up on other's screens.
Also determines how your contact will be stored.

Dynamic UID:
Enabling dynamic UID will allow the IP address
of a contact to be updated even if the computer's
generated unique ID does not match.  In other words, 
enabling this could easily allow somebody to
impersonate another individual while chatting with
you.  However, this is useful if your group switches
between computers frequently.

To exit while you are messaging somebody, type
cmd-exit and it will disconnect you from the
