This is just a simple, lightweight, Java
console app I am working on to develop my
engineering and coding skills in my free
time.  It is peer-to-peer, so it does not
use and servers.  LiteMessage uses a dynamic
contact system.  Initially, you have to
know the other user's IP address to initiate
a messaging sessions, but after that you can
use their screen name, so long as they stay
at the same computer.  However, because it is 
based off of IP addresses, it is really only
suitable foruse within the same LAN.  Of
course, if your network is set up correctly,
you could  use it across a WAN or Internet
connection. As far as I know, it should work
with IPv6 addresses, which gives you a little
more flexibility, but nobody wants to type
those out, even while shortened. I also
haven't tested the IPv6 capability, so who
knows. We will see if I, or someone else,
will figure out a solution to having
to know the distant end IP address.

More features will be added as I
develop a desire to make them.  Of course,
this is all open source.  If you are bored,
then by all means, go and create things
from the base source code that is provided.

A .bat file is provided for easy launching for Windows users.
