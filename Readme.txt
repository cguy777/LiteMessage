This is just a simple, lightweight, Java console app I am working on to develop my engineering and coding skills in my free time.  It is peer-to-peer, so it does not use any servers.  LiteMessage uses a dynamic contact system.  This means that it will save the contact info of the person you are messaging so you can easily find them at another time.

More features will be added as I develop a desire to make them.  Of course, this is all open source.  If you are bored, then by all means, go and create things from the base source code that is provided.

A .bat file is provided for easy launching for Windows users.
